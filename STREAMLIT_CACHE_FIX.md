# 🔄 Streamlit Cloud Cache Fix - Force Fresh Boot

## 🚨 The Problem
Streamlit Cloud is reusing cached environment and not picking up your changes, causing:
- Import errors
- Old service versions
- Configuration issues
- Dependency conflicts

## 💡 Instant Solutions

### Method 1: Force Cache Bust (Recommended)
Add this to your `app.py` at the very top:

```python
# Force cache bust - change this number to force fresh deployment
# Current deployment: v1.0.1
DEPLOYMENT_VERSION = "1.0.1"
```

**How it works**: Change the version number in each deployment to force Streamlit Cloud to rebuild.

### Method 2: Clear Streamlit's Temp Environment
In your Streamlit Cloud app dashboard:

1. **Go to App Settings** (⚙️ icon)
2. **Advanced Settings** tab
3. **Click "Clear Cache"** button
4. **Reboot App**

### Method 3: Dependency Cache Bust
Add a comment to `requirements.txt` with timestamp:

```txt
# Cache bust: 2024-08-15-18:30
streamlit>=1.45.1
google-generativeai>=0.8.5
# ... rest of requirements
```

### Method 4: Force Complete Rebuild
Create a `.streamlit/config.toml` change:

```toml
[server]
headless = true
# Force rebuild timestamp: 2024-08-15-18:30
enableCORS = false
```

## 🛠️ Automated Cache Busting

### Smart Cache Bust Script
```python
# Add this to the top of app.py
import time
import os

# Auto cache bust based on file modification time
def get_cache_bust():
    try:
        # Use the modification time of requirements.txt as cache key
        req_time = os.path.getmtime('requirements.txt')
        return f"v{int(req_time)}"
    except:
        return f"v{int(time.time())}"

CACHE_BUST = get_cache_bust()
```

## 🎯 Specific Streamlit Cloud Folders to Clear

### If you have SSH access to Streamlit Cloud (advanced):
```bash
# These are the folders Streamlit Cloud caches:
/app/.streamlit/
/tmp/streamlit/
~/.cache/pip/
/opt/conda/lib/python3.11/site-packages/
```

### Force pip to reinstall everything:
Add to `requirements.txt`:
```txt
# Force pip cache clear
--no-cache-dir
--force-reinstall
streamlit>=1.45.1
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy for Fresh Boot

### Step 1: Prepare for Fresh Deployment
```bash
# Update cache bust version
echo "# Deployment $(date): Force fresh boot" >> requirements.txt

# Or update version in app.py
sed -i 's/DEPLOYMENT_VERSION = .*/DEPLOYMENT_VERSION = "'$(date +%s)'"/' app.py
```

### Step 2: Deploy with Force Refresh
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Force fresh Streamlit Cloud deployment $(date)"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Manual Cache Clear (if needed)
1. Go to Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. App Settings → Advanced
3. Clear Cache → Reboot

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Persistent Issues

### If cache issues persist:

#### Option A: Rename Your App
1. In Streamlit Cloud, create a new app with different name
2. Point to same repository
3. Delete old app after new one works

#### Option B: Force Environment Rebuild
Add this to your `app.py`:

```python
import subprocess
import sys

def force_fresh_environment():
    """Force fresh package installation on Streamlit Cloud"""
    try:
        # This will force pip to reinstall packages
        subprocess.check_call([
            sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", 
            "--force-reinstall", "--no-cache-dir", "-r", "requirements.txt"
        ])
    except:
        pass  # Fail silently in production

# Uncomment this line to force fresh install (use sparingly)
# force_fresh_environment()
```

#### Option C: Repository Trick
1. Create new branch: `git checkout -b fresh-deploy`
2. Push to new branch: `git push origin fresh-deploy`
3. Update Streamlit Cloud to use new branch
4. Switch back to main later

## ⚡ Quick Commands for Fresh Deployment

### One-liner cache bust:
```bash
echo "# $(date)" >> requirements.txt && git add . && git commit -m "Cache bust" && git push
```

### Version bump in app.py:
```bash
sed -i "s/DEPLOYMENT_VERSION = .*/DEPLOYMENT_VERSION = \"$(date +%s)\"/" app.py
```

## 🎯 Prevention Tips

### Always include in your app:
1. **Version tracking** in app.py
2. **Timestamp comments** in requirements.txt  
3. **Cache clearing utilities** in settings
4. **Health check endpoints** for monitoring

### Best practices:
- Change version number for each deployment
- Use semantic versioning (1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.)
- Add deployment timestamps to config files
- Monitor Streamlit Cloud logs for cache hits/misses

## 🎉 Result
Your Streamlit Cloud app will boot fresh every time, picking up all your latest changes without cache issues!
